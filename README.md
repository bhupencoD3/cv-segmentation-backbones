# CV Segmentation Backbones

This repository contains implementations and experiments with popular image segmentation architectures using PyTorch, Detectron2, and Ultralytics.
The focus is on understanding how segmentation models are built, trained, and evaluated across different tasks such as semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation.
